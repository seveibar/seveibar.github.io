                The RPI Winter Carnival is a annual festival celebrated by all RPI students and has a reputation for being one of the biggest events on campus. During the 2014 Winter Carnival, I served as the Winter Carnival Web Designer and Web Master, as well as an event coordinator. The site can be seen <a href='http://carnival.union.rpi.edu/2014/'> here </a>.

            In RCOS, I worked on a project to replace the computer science department's homework server. Our homework server features fast algorithms, a more user friendly design, an intuitive instructor interface and much more.

Last semester I was a member of the drive-train team concentrating on 3D CAD and manufacturing. Our <a href='http://rev.union.rpi.edu/'> website </a> can provide more information.
